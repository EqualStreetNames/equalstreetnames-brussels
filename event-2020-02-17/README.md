## Data

This directory is used for the raw (not cleaned) data from the event organized on the 17th February 2020.

These data were split by municipality to make the split the work in a convenient way. These data should **not** be used for statistics (as it is not cleaned). If you're looking for the cleaned data (after process) and the documentation about the data, you should go to the [`static/` directory](../../static).
